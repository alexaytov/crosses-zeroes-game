Name of the game: crosses-zeroes
Type: board game
Size of the board: 15x15

Game descirption:

The game required two players to be played. 
One of the player is assigned corsses and the other is assigned zeroes at random.
Crosses are represented by the letter X.
The player with corsses starts first.
The player assigned with 
Each player places their assinged sign on one of the available fields. 
After a filed has a zero/cross it is no longer available. 
Winner: player who places their assigned sign five times horizontal, vertical or diagonal.

Functionality:

# Choice of which sign starts first.
# Choice to play against an AI or two player mode.
# Choice of which sign the AI uses.
# Reset a current game at any given time

Implementation details:

Dependencies:

# Programming language: Java
# Software platform: JavaFX
# Material design: JFoenix
# Version control system: Git/GitHub

# Algorithm used: minimax

Because of the high branching factor, the minimax algorithm is limited to look only one state ahead. 
If the algorithm looks more than one state ahead a noticable delay occurs.
Because of this limitation a better and more complex evaluation function is needed.
The evalution function grades not only the end states where there is a certain winner, but also
the two to three states leading up the the end state. The end state is when one of the players is established
as a winner or the game ends in a draw.

The AI choices are mostly influenced by the opponent actions, but if the AI sees and opurtunity to win
it will take it instead of blocking the opponent.
